##Consider two claims 
1. John claims that they can predict dice rolls/throws. To test John's claim, you roll a fair dice 10 times and John correctly predicts all 10.    
2. Jane claims that they can distinguish between natural and artificial sweeteners. To test Jane's claim, you give her 10 sweetener samples and Jane correctly identifies all 10      

--
Given this evidence, which of the 2 statements below do you most agree with?   

- **A.** John’s claim is just as strong as Jane’s claim    

- **B.** Jane’s claim is stronger than John’s claim       

--

**Choose A:** - &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Hardcore frequentist  &lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;
**Choose B:** - &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Latent Bayesian&lt;/span&gt;

## Before statistical inference
Before statistical inference, there is proper **study design ** and **data collection**      
 - Plenty of places to go wrong before statistical inference      

### &lt;span style="color:darkred"&gt;Questions to be asked:&lt;/span&gt;
- Is the sample representative of the population that we’d like to draw inferences about?      
- Are there systematic bias created by selection, misclassification or missing data at the design or during conduct of the study?     
- Are there known and observed, known and unobserved or unknown and unobserved variables that contaminate our conclusions?      
- What are the criteria for choosing a model (statistical vs causal)?      
- What analytical choices are made for the chosen model?

- Crowd source research project used **&lt;span style="color:darkred"&gt;1 dataset&lt;/span&gt;** and provided to 29 experienced analytic teams 
- Teams initially worked independently    
- But before final submission, each team's methods (without results) were circulated to the other teams and experts for review comments   
- Teams could then revise their methods or even change them before their final submission

### Researcher degrees of freedom

**Teams’ subjective beliefs about the primary research question across time.**

&lt;img src="images/L2redcard4.jpeg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

_Analysts’ subjective beliefs about the research hypothesis were **assessed four times during the project:** at registration, after accessing the data and submitting their analytic approach, when submitting final analyses, and after a group discussion of all the teams’ approaches and results. Responses were centered at 0, the range was from −2, for very unlikely, to +2, for very likely."_ [Many Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect Results](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646)

### Author's Conclusion

"_The observed results from analyzing a complex data set can be highly contingent on justifiable, but subjective, analytic decisions. Uncertainty in interpreting research results is therefore not just a function of statistical power or the use of questionable research practices; it is also **a function of the many reasonable decisions that researchers must make in order to conduct the research**_.    

_This does not mean that analyzing data and drawing research conclusions is a subjective enterprise with no connection to reality. It does mean that **many subjective decisions are part of the research process and can affect the outcomes. The best defense against subjectivity in science is to expose it**. Transparency in data, methods,and process gives the rest of the community opportunity to see the decisions, question them, offer alternatives, and test these alternatives in further research_."

--

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt; **Another take:** Subjective in data analysis is not restricted to Bayesian analyses  which indeed make their subjectivities fully transparent (priors)&lt;/span&gt;

##Statistical inference

- Statistical inference is the process of generating associations about a population from a sample, without it we’re left simply with our data

- Statistical models insufficient for causality  

- Paradox - models that are causally incorrect can make better  predictions than those that are causally correct     

- Probability models connect noisy sample data and populations and represent the most effective way to obtain inference     

- Inference is about belief revision, so Bayesian perspective seems logical and may provide additional insights (my personal, but not universally shared, belief)

---
class: middle
### Frequentist statistical inference (known falsehoods)

- Statistical methods alone can provide a number that by itself reflects a probability of reaching true / erroneous  conclusions

- Biological understanding and previous  research have little formal role in the interpretation of quantitative results     

- Standard statistical approach implies that conclusions can be produced with certain “random error rates,” without consideration of internal biases and external information        

- p values and hypothesis tests, are a mathematically coherent approach to inference    

---
class: middle
### Inference depends on the assumed statistical model
- The probability of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) =  `\(\dfrac{1}{8500}\)`      

- A UK mother, a lawyer, was on trial for infanticide as she had 2 children die of SIDS   

- An expert testified that the probability of 2 deaths in 1 family was `\((\dfrac{1}{8500})^2\)`  or 1 in 72 million      

- The mother was convicted. Do you agree with the conviction?   

---
class: middle
### Inference depends on the assumed statistical model

- There are 700,000 annual UK births and therefore about 82 first SIDS deaths       

- SIDS deaths are **not** independent as assumed -&gt; strong family occurrence &amp; the risk of a 2nd death is `\(\neq\)` 1 in 8500 but = 1 in 300          
- If SIDS families have a 2nd child, E(2nd death) `\(\approx\)` 4 years, &gt;&gt; 1 in 72 million    

- &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Don't know about her guilt but **statistical model and hence inference** was wrong!&lt;/span&gt;

## Statistical inference
.pull-left[
To make inferences we need to either refer to some common statistical distributions (normal, binomial, etc) or do simulations.

- A probability density function (pdf), is a function associated with a continuous random variable    
- This leads us to the central dogma of pdfs, namely the areas under the curve corresponds to probabilities for that random variable. To be a valid pdf, a function must:      
1. be larger than or equal to zero everywhere       
2. the total area under it must be one

##Contrasting views of probability

**&lt;span style="color:darkred"&gt;Frequency viewpoint:&lt;/span&gt;** probability parameters considered as **fixed** but unknown quantities, can’t make probability statements about them. Probability limited to sampling variability, i..e. in the long run proportion of times an event occurs in independent, identically distributed (iid) repetitions.     
&lt;br&gt;
**&lt;span style="color:darkred"&gt;Frequency style inference:&lt;/span&gt;** uses frequency interpretations of probabilities to control error rates. Answers questions like _“What should I decide given my data controlling the long run proportion of mistakes I make at a tolerable level.”_   
&lt;br&gt;
**&lt;span style="color:darkred"&gt;Bayesian viewpoint:&lt;/span&gt;** probability is the calculus of beliefs, with parameters that are considered **random** variables with probability distributions that follow the rules of probability         
&lt;br&gt;
**&lt;span style="color:darkred"&gt;Bayesian style inference:&lt;/span&gt;**  uses of  probability representation of beliefs to perform inference. Answers questions like _“Given my subjective beliefs and the objective information from the data, what should I believe now?”_

### Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST)
.pull-left[
&lt;img src="images/alpha.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- State `\(H_o\)`, `\(H_a\)`, `\(\alpha\)` error `\(\to\)` rejection area    
- Check if data falls into the rejection area     
- If yes, reject the null and accept the alternative, if no, can only say you don’t have enough evidence to reject     
]
.pull-right[
**Concerns with p values**   
- misinterpret as the “probability that the studied hypothesis is true”
- poor measure of strength of evidence; same value with small effect &amp; large study as with large effect in small study    
- often confused with `\(\alpha\)` error 
- can’t provide both “short run” evidential perspective which is inductive &amp; the long-run perspective, which is error-based and deductive experiment     
- often used to make “scientific conclusions &amp; policy decisions” when it provides no measure of effect size

##P value fallacy

##Other problems with statistical significance
- Statistical significance ≠ practical significance     
&lt;br&gt;
- Non-significance `\(\neq\)` zero effect      
&lt;br&gt;
- `\(\Delta\)` between statistically significant and not statistically significant is not itself statistically significant     
&lt;br&gt;
- Research degrees of freedom, p hacking &amp; forking paths     
&lt;br&gt;
- Statistical significance filter    
&lt;br&gt;
- Doesn't respect the likelihood principle (all the evidence in a sample relevant to model parameters is contained in the likelihood function)

&gt;A final concern is that statistically significant estimates tend to be overestimates. 

&gt;This is the type M,  or magnitude, error problem discussed in Section 4.4. Any estimate with p &lt; 0.05 is by necessity at  least two standard errors from zero. If a study has a high noise level, standard errors will be high, and  so statistically significant estimates will automatically be large, no matter how small the underlying  effect. Thus, **routine reliance on published, statistically significant results will lead to systematic  overestimation of effect sizes and a distorted view of the world.**  All the problems discussed above have led to what has been called a replication crisis, in which  studies published in leading scientific journals and conducted by researchers at respected universities  have failed to replicate. Many different problems in statistics and the culture of science have led to  the replication crisis; for our purposes here, what is relevant is to understand how to avoid some  statistical misconceptions associated with overcertainty.

## Statistical inference - Example 1
- A [study](https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d3450) reported that selective COX-2 inhibitors (NSAIDs) **were associated** with atrial fibrillation (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.33, p&lt;0.01)   
- A [2nd study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23046591/) concluded “use of selective COX-2 inhibitors **was not significantly related** to atrial fibrillation occurrence”  (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.97 - 1.47, p=.23)
- Authors elaborated why the results were different -  different populations, etc      
**Are the 2 results are really different?**

&lt;img src="images/forest.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
Only difference is better precision in 1st study, the 2nd study actually supports the 1st

##Statistical inference - Example 2
A recent 2022 [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2794879) reported _"annual screening (vs some screening) was associated with a **significant reduction in risk of prostate cancer–specific mortality (PCSM) among Black men (sHR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.92; P = .02)**_ 
- _but not among White men (sHR, 0.91; 95%CI, 0.74-1.11; P = .35)"_ and then concluded:     
- _&lt;span style="color:darkred"&gt;Annual screening was associated with reduced risk of PCSM among Black men but not among White men, suggesting that annual screening may be particularly important for Black men.&lt;/span&gt;_

## Avoiding nullism
Evidence **against** not only `\(H_o\)` but against any specific `\(H_a\)` better appreciated by considering the binary Shannon information, surprisal or **S value**. 

- `\(s = log_2(\dfrac{1}{P})\)` or  `\(P = (1/2)^s\)`, i.e = P(successive tosses of an unbiased coin showing only heads) 

- `\(S\)` _"as measuring our evidence against acceptability_"

- _"The S-value is designed to reduce incorrect probabilistic interpretations of statistics by providing a nonprobability measure of information supplied by the test statistic against the test hypothesis H"_

### Avoiding nullism
- Evidence against it's minimized at point estimate   
- `\(\downarrow\)` evidence against `\(H_a\)` of a 25% `\(\downarrow\)`, decrease with CABG than there is against `\(H_o\)`, which we have been told to accept!

##Bayesian Inference - What is it? 
- "Bayesian inference is **reallocation** of **credibility** across **possibilities**." (Kruschke, p. 15)
- "Bayesian data analysis takes a **question** in the form of a **model** and uses **logic** to produce an **answer** in the form of **probability distributions**." (McElreath, p. 10)
- "Bayesian inference is the **process** of **fitting** a **probability** **model** to a set of **data** and summarizing the result by a **probability distribution on the parameters** of the model and on **unobserved quantities** such as predictions for new observations." (Gelman, p. 1)

##Bayesian Inference
&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Bayes’ Theorem &lt;/span&gt; `\(\to\)` probability statements about hypotheses, model parameters or anything else that has associated uncertainty     

**&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Advantages&lt;/span&gt;**     
Treats unknown parameters as random variables -&gt; direct and meaningful answers (estimates)     
&lt;br&gt;
- Allows integration of all available information -&gt; mirrors sequential human learning with constant updating   
- Allows consideration of complex questions / models where all sources of uncertainty can be simultaneously and coherently considered    

**&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/span&gt;**         
Subjectivity (?)
Problem of induction (Hume / Popper - difficulty generalizing about future)

##Frequentist vs Bayesian (summary)

| Frequentist   | Bayesian  |
|---------------|-----------|
| Probability is "long-run frequency" | Probability is "degree of certainty" |
| `\(Pr(X \mid \theta)\)` is a sampling distribution&lt;br/&gt;(function of `\(X\)` with `\(\theta\)` fixed) | `\(Pr(X \mid \theta)\)` is a likelihood&lt;br/&gt;(function of `\(\theta\)` with `\(X\)` fixed) |
| No prior  | Prior |
| P-values (NHST) | Full probability model available for summary/decisions  |
| Confidence intervals  | Credible intervals    |
| Violates the "likelihood principle":&lt;br/&gt;&amp;emsp;Sampling intention matters&lt;br/&gt;&amp;emsp;Corrections for multiple testing&lt;br/&gt;&amp;emsp;Adjustment for planned/post hoc testing | Respects the "likelihood principle":&lt;br/&gt;&amp;emsp;Sampling intention is  irrelevant&lt;br/&gt;&amp;emsp;No corrections for multiple testing&lt;br/&gt;&amp;emsp;No adjustment for planned/post hoc testing |

### Calculations

`$$p(\theta \vert Y) \propto p(Y \vert \theta) p(\theta)$$`   
How the likelihood of each data point contributes 

`$$p(\theta \vert Y) \propto p(\theta) \prod^N_{n=1} p(y_n \vert \theta)$$`

For programming, add individual log probabilities

`$$\text{log}\ p(\theta \vert Y) \propto \text{log}\ p(\theta) + \sum^N_{n=1} \text{log}\ p(y_n \vert \theta)$$`

---
class: middle

### Calculations
- Stan and other Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques approximate high dimensional probability distributions 
- Stan uses [Hamiltonian MCMC](https://observablehq.com/@herbps10/hamiltonian-monte-carlo) to approximate `\(p(\theta \vert Y)\)`   

- We can write out (almost) any probabilistic model and get full probability distributions to express our uncertainty about model parameters     
- Higher-level interfaces allow us to avoid writing raw Stan code

```r
library(rstan)
library(brms)
library(rstanarm)
```

- Converts R modelling syntax to Stan language *and extends it in interesting ways*

##Bayesian workflow

To get started with Bayesian data analysis (BDA), it is useful to first informally define what a "Bayesian workflow" might look like.      
&lt;br&gt;
Five key data analysis steps follow;   

1.  Identify data relevant to the research question     
2.  Define a descriptive model, whose parameters capture the research question      
3.  Specify prior probability distributions on parameters in the model    
4.  Update the prior to a posterior distribution using Bayesian inference    
5.  Check your model against data, and identify possible problems    

---
##Defining the model
Usually model written as

`$$y_n = \mu + \epsilon_n$$`

where

`$$\epsilon_n \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$`

Bayesian usually prefer the following equivalent form

`$$y_n \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$`
Need to define prior beliefs, before the data are observed. Requires care, and often a vague or non-informative priors are useful starting points.
`$$\mu \sim N(250, 200) \\
\sigma \sim N^+(0, 200)$$`

---
##Defining the priors
`$$\mu \sim N(250, 200) \\
\sigma \sim N^+(0, 200)$$`

##Statistical inference - Example 3
A case-control [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27041698/) of statins and risk of glioma, reported OR = 0.75; 95 % CI 0.48–1.17 when comparing users (&gt;90 Rx) to non-users.     

The authors then made the following statements      
1) "As compared with non-use of statins, use of statins was not associated with risk of glioma"        
2) "This matched case-control study revealed a null association between statin use and risk of glioma"           
Do you agree?    

--

**Both statements are flat-out wrong**     
- Misinterpreting that their CI included the null as meaning no association   
- Tests of significance, by comparing p to `\(\alpha\)` or by looking for null values within CI, are worse than useless, they are misleading and inhibit critical discussion    
- Values just beyond the CI are only slightly less likely to have given rise to the observed data than are some of the values included in the CI
